# React Plugin Starter

A quick experiment and (hopefully) an effecient way to start using react to build quick little things that outputs HTML and JS.

### Next Steps:

- create boilerplate plugin stuffs like plugin header
- make this an embedable app with wp\*enqueue_scripts and add_shortcodes
- probably need to change reference from including react to making wp.element a dependency (see Zac's article)
- maybe create an `npx create-react-shortcode` boilerplate... Although just found this: https://github.com/gopangolin/wp-reactivate so maybe I can use that going forward... `¯\_(ツ)\*/¯`
